# Icon

To add a custom icon for this integration in HACS, you can:

1. Create a 512x512 PNG image with the Trello logo or a custom icon
2. Save it as `icon.png` in the root of the repository
3. Commit and push to GitHub

For now, Home Assistant will use the default Trello MDI icon (mdi:trello) for the sensors.

If you'd like me to generate a custom icon design, I can create one for you!
